Employee Directory
A simple and interactive Employee Directory Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, view, and delete employee records with persistent storage using LocalStorage — so data remains even after refreshing the page.

 LocalStorage Integration — Employees are saved locally in your browser.
 Delete Employee — Easily remove an employee from the directory.
 Duplicate Check — Prevents adding employees with the same email.
 Instant Updates — Automatically refreshes the employee list after every action.
 Form Validation — Ensures valid and complete data entry.
 Responsive UI — Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
 Animated Design — Includes slide-in animations and hover effects.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure and layout
CSS3 – Styling and responsiveness
JavaScript (ES6) – Logic and interactivity
LocalStorage – For data persistence
